order of code (NOTE: some things will need to be explained / copied over from documentation before people can go off on their own)
- import necessary libraries
- constants (separate folders give visual as to general code structure)
- swerve constants
- swerve module (explain how swerve works compared to other drivetrain types)
    - angle motor pid
    - getting and setting values
    - all necessary configurations
- drivetrainstate - feeds into robot state
- robot state (feeds into drivetrain) - singelton programming
- drivetrain subsystem - singleton programming
    - all the different drive methods
    - chassis speeds
- drive command
    - slew axis
    - deadband
    - suppliers
- bind driving to joysticks - set drivetrain default command to driving

- subsystems - revisit singleton programming (get Instance method for each)
    - intake
    - hopper
    - indexer 
    - shooter - use the same sim motors as the indexer xrs - same system to make it easier?

    - explain why we use command factory vs just commands (screenshots of 2024 vs 2025 code)
        - command factory for intake + hopper
            - Commands and Command classes, ways to re-route the traditional Commands
            - note: do we want them to be doing it the trad way or the shortcut way???? maybe both to understand why we switched
                - could be additional challenge - change commands into command factory
            - runnable (lambda), NOT a command
        - command factory for indexer + shooter
            - RobotContainer setup makes more sense when you do all the button binding @ once

*** NOTE - Commands.run
    - instant command loop - calls lambda every scheduler like execute(), and continues doing so as long as the command is scheduled
    - when command ends, .finallyDo() is run - can be interrupted through end of .whileTrue() when button binding

        - RobotContainer -> set up singe-object reference for all (singleton programming)
        - set up buttons for intake + hopper
        - set up buttons for indexer + shooter

    - after setting up buttons, make sure you use methods to stop mechanisms when you let go of certain buttons
        
- advantagescope / set up prints and logging for subsystems to troubleshoot
