order of code
- import necessary libraries
- constants (separate folders give visual as to general code structure)
- swerve constants
- swerve module (explain how swerve works compared to other drivetrain types)
    - angle motor pid
    - getting and setting values
    - all necessary configurations
- drivetrainstate - feeds into robot state
- robot state (feeds into drivetrain) - singelton programming
- drivetrain subsystem - singleton programming
    - all the different drive methods
    - chassis speeds
- drive command
    - slew axis
    - deadband
    - suppliers
- bind driving to joysticks - set drivetrain default command to driving

- subsystems - revisit singleton programming (get Instance)
    - intake
    - hopper
    - indexer 
    - shooter - use the same sim motors as the indexer xrs - same system to make it easier?

    - explain why we use command factory vs just commands (screenshots of 2024 vs 2025 code)
        - command factory for intake + hopper
        - set up buttons for intake + hopper
        - command factory for indexer + shooter
        - set up buttons for indexer + shooter
        
- advantagescope / set up prints and logging for subsystems to troubleshoot
